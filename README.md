# 📖 Overview

BloodBridge is a modern Android application developed to simplify and digitize the blood donation process by connecting donors, recipients, and hospitals through a secure and user-friendly platform.

Traditional blood donation systems often depend on manual records, phone calls, and local donation drives, making it difficult to respond quickly during emergencies. BloodBridge addresses these challenges by leveraging **Kotlin**, **Firebase**, and **Google Maps** to provide real-time communication, cloud-based data storage, and efficient donor management.

The application enables users to register securely, donate blood, request blood during emergencies, maintain donation history, receive instant notifications, and locate suitable donors based on blood group and location. Hospitals can securely manage donor information, verify accounts, publish emergency blood requests, and provide medical reports directly to donors.

Designed with simplicity, reliability, and accessibility in mind, BloodBridge aims to make blood donation faster, more organized, and readily available whenever lives depend on it.
